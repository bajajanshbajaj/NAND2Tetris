This repository contains two Hack assembly programs for the Nand2Tetris course:

1. Mult.asm – Multiplies values in R0 and R1, storing the result in R2. The program does not modify R0 or R1. Test with the provided Mult.test script.
2. Fill.asm – Continuously listens for keypresses. If a key is pressed, the screen turns black. If no key is pressed, the screen is white.
