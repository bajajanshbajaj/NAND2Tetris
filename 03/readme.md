Project 3: Memory

This repository contains the implementation of a series of memory chips that work together to form a functioning Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. 

The goal of this project is to construct the following chips:

DFF (given): Data Flip-Flop, the basic unit for storing data.
Bit: A single bit of memory, implemented with DFFs.
Register: A register made up of multiple bits, capable of storing a multi-bit value.
RAM8: A memory unit with 8 registers.
RAM64: A memory unit with 64 registers.
RAM512: A memory unit with 512 registers.
RAM4K: A memory unit with 4096 registers.
RAM16K: A memory unit with 16,384 registers.
PC (Program Counter): A special register that holds the address of the next instruction
