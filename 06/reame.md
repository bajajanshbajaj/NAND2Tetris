Project 6 of the Nand2Tetris course focuses on implementing a machine language interpreter (assembler).
In this project, i have built a program that converts hack assembly (.asm) language to machine code (.hack). 

I have opted for a gui for selection of the asm files using tkinter rather than a cli interface. 

The GUI allows users to select .asm files easily and automatically generates the corresponding Hack machine code. 
This provides a more intuitive way to interact with the assembler compared to the traditional command-line interface.
