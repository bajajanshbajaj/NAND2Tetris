Project 8: VM to Assembly Converter

This repository contains Project 8 of the Nand2Tetris course, which focuses on implementing a VM to assembly converter. In this project, I have developed a program that converts Virtual Machine (VM) bytecode instructions (.vm) into their equivalent Hack assembly language instructions (.asm).

To improve the user experience, I have implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. This interface allows users to easily select a .vm file, and the program automatically generates the corresponding .asm file. The GUI offers a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the converter compared to a traditional command-line interface.

The program translates each VM instruction into its Hack assembly equivalent, providing a bridge between higher-level VM code and the lower-level assembly language used by the Hack computer. This project is a key step in understanding the compilation process, as it demonstrates how high-level operations are broken down into assembly instructions.
