This repository contains the implementation of Project 1 from the Nand2Tetris course. In this project, the goal was to create a set of basic logic gates using only the NAND gate, following the principles of Boolean logic.

The project demonstrates how to build complex circuits starting with the simplest building block: the NAND gate. The project consists of designing and simulating various logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, XOR, MUX, etc., using a hardware description language (HDL).
