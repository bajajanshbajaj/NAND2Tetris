This directory contains Project 10 of the Nand2Tetris course, which focuses on building the syntax analysis phase of the Jack compiler. 
The goal of this project is to parse Jack source code (.jack files) and produce an XML Tree representation of its grammatical structure.

Files
analyser.py
The main driver script. It opens a Tkinter folder selection window, allowing the user to select a directory containing Jack files.
The script then initiates the compilation process for all .jack files in the selected directory.

tokeniser.py
Implements the Jack tokenizer and performs lexical analysis. 
It breaks the input stream into individual tokens, such as keywords, symbols, identifiers, integer constants, and string constants.

compilationengine.py
Implements the compilation engine.
It reads the tokens generated by the tokenizer and recursively applies the Jack grammar rules to produce a structured XML syntax tree.
