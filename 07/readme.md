Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic

This repository contains my implementation for Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic from the Nand2Tetris course.
The project focuses on building a simple virtual machine (VM) that supports arithmetic and logical operations on a stack.
The VM interpreter translates high-level stack operations into corresponding low-level machine code instructions.

I have opted for a gui for selection of the .vm files using tkinter rather than a cli interface.
The GUI allows users to select .vm files easily and automatically generates the corresponding Assembly code.
This provides a more intuitive way to interact with the assembler compared to the traditional command-line interface.
