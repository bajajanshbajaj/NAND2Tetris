NAND2Tetris Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

This repository contains the solution for Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic from the NAND2Tetris course. The project focuses on building the essential arithmetic components required for constructing the ALU (Arithmetic-Logic Unit) of the Hack computer. By completing this project, you will gradually build the chips that handle arithmetic operations, culminating in the ALU.

Project Overview
The repository includes HDL (Hardware Description Language) files for the following chips:

HalfAdder: A circuit that adds two 1-bit numbers and produces a sum and carry-out.
FullAdder: A more advanced adder that includes carry-in, adding three 1-bit numbers.
Add16: A 16-bit adder for adding two 16-bit numbers.
Inc16: A chip that increments a 16-bit number by 1.
ALU: A chip that performs various arithmetic and logical operations using the previously built components.
